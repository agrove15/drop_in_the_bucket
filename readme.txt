The game hosted here is a simple web-application that uses you mouse pointer. 
A bucket image follows your pointer around the screen while rain drops fall 
from the clouds above. Simply move the bucket onto or under the drop to collect 
it before it hits the grass. You can choose how easy or challenging you would 
like the game to be and you get 3 lives. If you lose a life, you will get a 
chance to recover one, just like you collect the rain drops. So â€¦ how many 
drops can you collect!?!?!
